## Decorator Design Pattern

The decorator pattern is a structural pattern, that allows you to attach additional responsibilities to an object at run time.

The decorator pattern is used in both the Object Oriented and Functional paradigms.

The decorator patter is different than  the Python language feature of Python Decorators but the application of it is the same, in the way that it's essentially a wrapper.

The Decorator pattern adds extesibility, without modifying the origial functiona.
